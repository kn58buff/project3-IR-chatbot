Symptoms generally include high susceptibility to pathogens, chronic lung disease, as well as inflammation and infection of the gastrointestinal tract. CVID affects males and females equally. The condition can be found in children or teens but is generally not diagnosed or recognized until adulthood. The average age of diagnosis is between 20 and 50. However, symptoms vary greatly between people. \"Variable\" refers to the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of this disorder, which include recurrent bacterial infections, increased risk for autoimmune disease and lymphoma, as well as gastrointestinal disease. CVID is a lifelong disease.'"
